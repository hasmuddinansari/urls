## 1. Infinite Scroll 

### About : 

Infinite scroll is a web design feature where new content automatically loads as users scroll down a page, eliminating the need for pagination. It enhances user experience by providing seamless browsing, but can also lead to information overload and navigation difficulties in lengthy content-heavy sites if not implemented carefully.
